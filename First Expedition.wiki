= The First Expedition =

Despite its name, the First Expedition was not much of an expedition, nor did it accomplish much.

== Events ==
About 100 workers of Kalevala decided to explore the lands of Esoteria beyond Kalevala.

However, another devastating earthquake struck only 2 days into the journey, killing 7 of the members.

The remaining 93 felt that they were being punished by the world, and decided to return to check on their families.


== Impact ==

The First Expedition made many Kalevalians suspicious of venturing too far into the world.
